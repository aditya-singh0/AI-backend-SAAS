- QR codes often appear only for exact matches

### 2. CAPTCHA Solving
- Make sure to view the downloaded `captcha_image.png` clearly
- Enter exactly what you see (case-sensitive)
- If CAPTCHA fails, restart the script for a new one

### 3. Form Field Values
- Check the displayed dropdown options for valid IDs
- Use numeric IDs that appear in the option lists
- Some fields may be required depending on the search type

### 4. Property Information
- If you're looking for a specific property, have details ready:
  - District name/ID
  - Taluka/Sub-district
  - Village name
  - Property/article type

## Troubleshooting

### CAPTCHA Issues
- **Image not downloading**: Check internet connection
- **Wrong CAPTCHA**: Try again with a fresh session
- **CAPTCHA not detected**: The website structure may have changed

### Form Submission Issues
- **Required fields**: Some combinations of fields may be required
- **Invalid selections**: Use only IDs that appear in the dropdown options
- **Timeout errors**: Government websites can be slow, try again

### No QR Codes Found
- **Wrong page**: QR codes may only appear on specific result pages
- **Different location**: Try searching for specific properties
- **Dynamic content**: Some QR codes are generated client-side

## Advanced Usage

```python
from src.igr_specialized_scraper import IGRSpecializedScraper

scraper = IGRSpecializedScraper()
results = scraper.scrape_qr_codes_from_soup(soup_object, base_url)
```

### Batch Processing
For multiple properties, you can modify the script to loop through property IDs.
